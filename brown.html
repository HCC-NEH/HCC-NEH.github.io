<div class="content">
<p>For my project, I found a news article about segregation in middle schools in the Harford County area. It specifically said that kids of color would have to take an exam in order to get into a school that they wanted to attend. 
    Furthermore, with my project, I created a twitter account, not an actual account, for one of the kids effected listed in the article. In more detail, 
    I wrote different twitter feeds about the situation that was happening through the kids world. 
    Something unique that I've never done before, and it was honestly quite fun. </p>

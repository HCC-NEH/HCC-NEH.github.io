<h2>HCRP Reflection</h2>
<i>Raven Albin</i>
<div class = "content">
<p> As a young man who has lived in Baltimore county for all of my life I have not looked into the history 
    of my county or Harford county. However that changed when I enrolled at Harford community college. 
    Now I enrolled in US history 1 and 2 with professor Dixon and he introduced me to some events in Harford 
    county. Now last semester would be my first step into civil rights in Harford county when I went and listen to
    Mr. Stamps. That day would get me intrigued with local history. Flash forward to today doing this project made 
    me open my eyes to that the civil rights movement was more than just Rosa Parks, MLK, and Malcolm X fighting 
    for civil rights. This project made me realize that when I was in high school and talked about the civil rights 
    movement none of my teachers mentioned key important events that mot only happened in our state but In our 
    backyard. We didn’t talk about Harford Memorial and Mr. Stamps, the route 40 dinners, and anything in our county 
    involving parks. If it wasn’t for this I would have never learned any of this. Finally with this project it 
    made me realize these fight for equality had multiple phases from public places, to schools, and housing. I 
    those phases it took a lot of resources and groups like the NAACP, CORE, and freedom rider and other groups
    to push forward in civil rights and educate the public and the nation what was happening in the African 
    American community.  .I feel like everyone should take an African American History class because not only 
    do you get to learn about a different race or learn more about your culture and heritage, you get to learn 
    about the history of your state and county and the lasting impact it has on you but other people in the area.</p>

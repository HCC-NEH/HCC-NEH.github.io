The humanities career day that features Dr.Iris Barnes what I learned today was that you need to be true to yourself that you should always revient yourself and you never stop learning. Find your passion in life do whats true to your heart desire.You must love what you do. Education and training are two of the keys that you will need in order to succeed.  In order to be great at what you do practice, practice and practice some more.Find out what opportunities are out there. If you don't have a mentor get one never burn your bridges you'll never know when you will need  their help again.Networking is the object of the game to sell yourself.Find the light in all you do it is o.k. To reinvent yourself,stay sharp and on your game by being committed to the work.At times you might have to  change careers but look at this as a new opportunities not failure .Keeping up with the times and seek what new opportunities are out there for you.Do your best put forth the work and never let anyone push you in a direction  that your not sure of.Money is good but it will not fill the void that you have in your heart is not in it.Most of all have fun enjoy what you do.Communication is important being able to speak and write it will help you in the  long run.Don't count what you been through as failure but as away to see things in a different light.Go volunteer to get the skills that you will need later down the road.Put your name out there on people's heart and mind. Volunteering can open many doors now that will help you later in life.Don't turn down your nose to small opporantieds.Go to the conferences and fellowship with people in the field in which your trying to go.Look for  internships -build yourself never let opportunity pass you by.Most of all think outside the box.Be creative and a team player most of all enjoy yourself and have fun doing your heart desire this your career.

The article also shows that the resentment towards desegregation and the deliberate delays and avoidance of the process of desegregation in schools was far more common than just the few instances that are discussed in the textbook.  In the textbook its self we see far more extreme instances where states called in the nation guard to prevent colored children from attending schools and even schools closing all together.  It is shocking that during this time, some states and counties would rather shut down their schools completely than allow colored children to attend.

This article showed me that desegregation was not as simple as the supreme court telling states that they had to integrate schools.  It showed me that it was a lot of fighting from both sides, both for and against, and that it took years for colored people to achieve the equality they deserved.  I think that this translates into many aspects of the civil rights movement. It proved that just because it’s the law, doesn’t mean people with abide by it.  This can be seen in situations such as the desegregation of public areas where colored people would be physically assaulted and in some places were even arrested for doing things that federal law and the  constitution stated they could do.

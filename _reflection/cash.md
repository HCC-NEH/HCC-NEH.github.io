Desegregation of Harford Country Public Schools  ​The reason I chose this topic is because I want to become a special education teacher. I believe that this topic is a great viewpoint of what happened to teachers and students in the past with the desegregation of the schools.  The years involved in the desegregation of Harford County Public schools are from the mid 1800’s through the end of the 1900’s. I think it was tragic the things that happened throughout the desegregation of Harford County  Public schools but I think it was mostly tragic for the teachers and everything they had to go through.

From 1837-1994 Maryland when the supreme court first spoke about the desegregation in schools the State and local officials accepted it as a law of the land.  Nearly half of the African American students were attending Caucasian schools. “If there’s an all-black school and an all-white school over here, there would be students in the black school who could progress as well as the  whites, but as long as they stay separate, they would never get the same things to work…. that’s the problem.” The reason this is relevant is because of the fact that the teacher has a point if the schools were desegregated  then the Caucasians and the African Americans could learn the same things and wouldn’t has a ton of conflicts.     In the 1930’s teachers went to work with less public agitation. Yet the African Americans were still faced with many obstacles just because of their ethnic and cultural background and their skin color.  African American teachers and students had it rough through the 1900’s. African Americans have had it hard trying to get jobs everywhere since the 1900’s. 

In 1940 Viola Duval Stewart challenged unequal pay scales of black and white teachers. She had then won her case of unequal pay. Southern schools were still legally segregated and African Americans were being treated horribly unfair. African American schools received less funding and less supplies. White children and white schools were far more superior, and they were equipped with more up to date supplies.

The school board of Harford County scheduled a four-year program which would begin with high school grades and then incorporate the elementary level.  The four year plan had some rules and these are what they were. “1. The discontinuance or limitation of transfer policy is a denial of constitutional rights... 2.  The continued existence of segregated schools in our community for, four more years raises serious questions as to the responsibility and morality of the people… 3.  No provisions are made for employment of additional negro teachers during the next four years. 4. The cost of transporting pupils’ long distances to the African American schools will continue to be uneconomical.”  The reason that these rules are relevant is that they show how the schools are being treated and how there are problems with the past’s society. 

All of the events and topics that I have talked about are all helpful and beneficial to learning about the different problems with education in the 1900’s.  Desegregation in schools was a huge issue at first and then later in the 1900’s towards the end of the 1900’s. The teachers eventually had a better break in working with each other.

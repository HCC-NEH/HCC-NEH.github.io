This article helped me to understand other aspects like, as mentioned in our textbook, that “until 1954,  racial segregation in education was not only legal but was required in seventeen states and permissible in several others,” (US History).  This statement helped me make sense of why the Harford County School Board turned down the group of black Americans who were protesting. It also helped me to understand how poorly black Americans were treated in schools.  Also, as mentioned in our textbook, students were separated from others based on their race.  Then, when efforts were made to desegregate public schools, there was a lot of backlash from most southern whites.  There was also a lot of violence from the southern whites when some schools desegregated. This information has taught me how racist and unjustifiable the southern whites were during the civil rights movement.

This article taught me that people wanted desegregation in the public schools and for those people of color to feel like they are not inferior, but superior.  Southern whites, however, still wanted segregation in the public schools. Fortunately, changes were made and there no longer is segregation in public schools.

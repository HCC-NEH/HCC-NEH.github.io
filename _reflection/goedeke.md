This presentation brought to my attention just how much of a systemic issue racism and segregation was in Harford County. Unfortunately, I have never heard of any of this information before.  This was all new information that I wish had been brought to my attention earlier. I was aware Harford County had a bad past. Such as prostitution in Havre De Grace.  However, this showed an entirely different side to the land in which I grew up. 

The most interesting part of the presentation was the Afro-American Expose. The US and Maryland set themselves up for failure when they attempted to integrate laws that only lead to desegregation of African Diplomats.  One would think they would see through their biases and realize this would cause issues in the future. However, it is easy to say this in hindsight 

The Afro-American Expose demonstrated just how flawed the newly implemented laws were. A reported named Herbert (Could not find the spelling to his last name.  His name is said in Part 2 at timestamp 26:20) dresses up as what he thinks an African Diplomat would look like. He barrows a cousin's limo and speaks in a fake African accent.  And he has his fellow staffers roll up to restaurants and they said he was the finance manager of Goban (A made up country. Which switches the vowels of Gabon).  They are served at the restaurant and receive good service while there. This experience is published in The Afro. This demonstrates the hypocrisy of the laws to the people. 

This was the most fascinating part of the presentation. However, close behind this was the correlation to these events and the Cold War. The news of the unfair treatment of the African Diplomats made its way across the world.  Papers were written about the unfair treatment in the Soviet Union in order to maintain their regimen. This helped the Soviet Union to paint the US in a negative light. 

Personally, I found the presentation interesting. It demonstrated a weakness that still exists in this country. This shows why there is a large disconnect in Maryland.  Some of these feelings still exist. These issues will permeate for a long time. However, some day, people will hopefully find peace in themselves and bring a positive message with them.

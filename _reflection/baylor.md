My last bit of research comes from another article titled, “6 Are Arrested on Freedom Ride:Trepass Charges Follow U.S. 40 Demonstration.” It tells the story of a few college studentstraveling from up north to the south and  along their travel they decided to test segregatedrestaurants. They would spread out into small groups all up and down U.S.40 from Baltimore,Maryland to Delaware making their presence known.  These group of individuals were known asFreedom Riders. A Freedom Rider was someone who challenged racial laws up and down the eastcoast mainly in the American South in the late 1950’s and 60’s.  They would challenge those raciallaws by refusing to sit in law assigned

The cohesiveness with de-segregation and these articles tells the process of how dividedthis country has always been. Many movements have been created over the years to continue toprotect and help grow our black communities.  Movements and associations like the NAACP, TheCivil Rights Movement, The Black Panthers and The Black Lives Matter Movement. Even whenAfrican Americans feel like we have been held in a chokehold and robbed of our  dignity andrespect we still rise and shine on our enemy. The oppressor has tried to keep us down for centuries,but we will never let that happen. African Americans will continue to fight no matter how long ittakes  to us defeat all odds against us. Even though my ancestors broke through the chains ofinjustice and inequality, it still seems like we have more work to do. The change must begin withourselves.  Prayerfully, as time goes on everything will work out for the better

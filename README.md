# HCC-NEH.github.io

# This project arose from a grant given by the National Endowment for the Humanities
# to document our students' experience and reflections and to share them with the 
# world. 

# We are using Visual Studio Code with a GitHub repository to make and host the static site
# and we are using AWS/S3 for hosting our images and Vimeo for videos.

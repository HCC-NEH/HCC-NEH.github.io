<p>It is amazing to see how far we as a black community have progressed, but it often looks like we are falling back behind.  Looking at Baltimore alone, it is a shock that such a place even exists in Maryland.  
    It is a place filled with my own kind, but a place I would not dare to live.  When I look at Baltimore, I can only think “From slavery, to this?”  
    I think that these people are more trapped in their own homes than they ever were in slavery.  Here in Baltimore, many actually do not want to leave, while most slaves would sacrifice anything for freedom.  
    I think that the biggest problem facing the black community today is the imaginary glass ceiling.  All it takes is determination before our young black youth can start leaving Baltimore, drugs and drinking, and 
    all that is fun to get a real job and make their own cash.  Seeing how our previous generations survived the Reconstruction, kept their families together, and rose in government and power, we have no excuse to do the best we can 
    today with all our resources.</p>   

<p>I cannot think about Maryland history without thinking about Ben Carson.  He grew up in a single mother household, with a mother who could not even read, but she was determined that her children would not end up like her.  
    Ben Carson rose from a failing student to the top of his class.  It is that type of determination that I would love to see our black community have once again, and soon everything else will fall in line.</p>

<p>For my HCPR project, I read and analyzed a news article from the resources provided on Blackboard. The article I chose I thought was interesting and one that I would be able to expand on and go into detail with. 
    This project has been very informative and made me look into and research Harford County on a topic more extensive than I ever would have before. I've really enjoyed it.  </p>

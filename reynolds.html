<p> Equality; an important theme of the Civil Rights Movement. This interview illuminates this theme well. Burt talked about so many positive aspects of his life during the Civil Rights Movement, 
    but a couple negative aspects he explained were related to equality. He spoke about how he remembers seeing other white schools with these amazing turf football fields, sports teams, and resources in school 
    that the colored schools did not have access to. He explains that even though him and lots of his friends still succeeded without these resources, 
    they may have made his and all the other students lives easier and more productive.</p> 
    
<p>The information I received in the oral history interview helps me to understand an important part of the movement, the educators. 
    Burt went on and on about how amazing his teachers were while he was in school. He explains how helpful, caring and supportive they were. 
    He also mentioned that with all the racial discrimination and racial segregation, the teachers were never talking about the issues going on in the world, they never seemed angry about it at school, 
    they were always focused on giving the best education possible.</p>   
    
<p>During this class, I have gotten to listen to a few oral history interviews of African Americans who lived through the Civil Rights Era and none of them let their struggles get in the way of an education or a career! 
    I loved listening to a story from people who lived through the Civil Rights Movement, especially someone from Maryland! Iâ€™m glad I got to learn more about Civil Rights and what people went through during those times.</p>

<div class="content">
<p> Due to the board's admission and transfer policies, Pettit was forced to attend a school that his father argued to have an inadequate curriculum. 
    He went through some hardships, which is also one of the main reasons the NAACP was so involved in supporting his case. It is very commendable for NAACP to have taken this path since Pettit is now an icon because of 
    sticking to the fight of social injustice and racial discrimination. Now, the black child is freer thanks to this feat and not only has to study in consolidated schools. </p> 
    
<p>A lot can be emulated from the scenario of Pettit in that through the civil rights movements, especially NAACP, a lot will not be tolerated in regards to discrimination. 
    Whole institutions who used to discriminate the black man now have to change their norms of operation since from NAACP, more movements such as the Black Lives Matter are coming up to protect the black 
    man in a society where he was at a disadvantage. </p>

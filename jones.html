<div class="content">
<p>In the course of my participation in the Harford County Civil Rights Project (HCRP) I have become enlightened to a simple yet profound truth about the Civil Rights Movement: 
    my home is as much a part of this rich history as any jurisdiction in America. Throughout my efforts to investigate the issues of housing and employment discrimination in Harford County during the 1960’s, 
    I have become increasingly amazed by the fact that Harford County experienced the stinging barbs of racism  in ways that are comparable to distant southern locales. Those distant geographic places, with names like Selma, 
    Montgomery, and Birmingham have long been etched in my mind as the primary scenes where the Civil Rights Movement transpired. These cities in the Deep South were essentially the frontline battles sites of the movement, and 
    their place in history is for all time. However, I became aware that for every Selma, there was an Aberdeen and for every Montgomery there was a Havre de Grace. For every city that witnessed a monumental protest, there were 
    numerous others that experienced the Civil Rights Movement in ways that were less violent, but just as meaningful. One particular case that shaped my understanding of the movement in Harford County, involved a gentleman by the 
    name of Brennie E. Hackley. Mr. Hackley’s story of being denied the right to live in the Edgewood Meadows neighborhood in the late 1950’s, underscores two key concepts that define the history of civil rights in America: 
    the prevalence of bigotry in our land, alongside the resilience of the victims of that bigotry. Like so many others who preceded and succeeded Mr. Hackley, the resistance to acts of discrimination, 
    either in the streets or the courts, became a defining aspect of the struggle. For Mr. Hackley, the resistance to his exposure to discrimination came in the form of litigation against the housing developments who denied him 
    the write to live by none but his own will. While the case was dismissed on technical grounds, the defiance of Mr. Hackley is an inspiration, to never tolerate the use of race as a determining factor in where a human being can live. 
    In discovering Mr. Hackley’s experience, I became awakened to the reality that my home, Harford County, was a microcosm of the wider movement for social change. My conception of the Civil Rights Movement will never be the same. </p>

<p>(This writer fervently attempted to upload a reflection to his team’s Instagram page, but encountered a series of errors that he is still trying to comprehend. 
    As the rest of my team included photographs of themselves alongside their reflections, my submission devoid of an image would have led to an incongruous situation, 
    thus I have transcribed my thoughts into a standard Word format.) </p>

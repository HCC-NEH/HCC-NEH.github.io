            <p>Working on this project, it really put things in perspective for me, on how close and recent the events of the
                civil rights movement were to us. Sixty years ago, on this road, Route 40, there were still tons of businesses
                that practiced segregation, despite the fact it was made illegal at that time. Now (?) made thousands of pamphlets
                and passed them out all along Route 40, to combat this. I know for some, sixty years ago seems like a very long time,
                but in the grand scheme of history, 60 years ago was not that long ago. There are still people here who saw the
                events on Route 40, which is crazy to think about.</p>

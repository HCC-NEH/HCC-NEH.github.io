<h2>Reflection</h2>
<i>Joe Neskow</i>

<div class="content">
<p> You frequently hear about the large marches upon Washington in demand of equal rights, but it is because of local gatherings and demonstrations such as the ones that occurred in greater Harford County region, that laws were created. 
    These demonstrations and protests enlighten the actions taken by locals, that blacks all over the United States were coopering for freedom. 
    In the article there is a quote from a local NAACP representative, Mrs. Janice Grant, in which she describes how it wasn’t only the Veterans being discriminated against. 
    Mrs. Grant says, “There were refusals for government employees, schoolteachers, and all who were colored on all economic levels by county realtors.” 
    Mrs. Grant’s statement furthermore enlightens the discrimination against all levels of blacks, even veterans. </p>   

<p>This was a significant time in the United States and it demonstrates that it wasn’t just blacks in the south which faced challenges. 
    In fact, the reality is that blacks were hated everywhere, and white realtors even refused to sell to black American Heroes this far north. 
    It cannot be stressed enough how critical this for understanding the Civil Rights Movement as blacks fought everywhere over the nation. 
    This was truly a time in which Americans had to face hatred everyday no matter where they were within this country. 
    It is sad that to look upon our past and see that our fellow Americans suffered daily for rights that are so deemed unalienable. </p>

<p> Above is my url for my website, I hope you guys enjoy it! I made a informational website with a interactive blog, photos, additional links to videos and such to follow, and an informational tab. 
    Throughout this project I learned a lot about Harford County (Iâ€™m not from here), their beginnings in fighting racism and desegregating schools. 
    I learned that they were one of the last counties in America to convert to desegregated schools. 
    I also learned that there was a community in Havre de Grace that accepted anyone black or white. I also learned how to create a website which will be helpful sometime in the future!  </p>

        <div>
            <p> It’s been more than 50 years since the Civil Rights Act and it still feels like we’re fighting for the same issues. Although more African Americans now have the opportunity to live in Harford County, it comes with its consequences. 
            My children have been profiled by local law enforcement and our neighborhood has been subject to ignorant incidents in the past. 
            The last paragraph of the article mentions that protestors held demonstrations throughout Harford County to voice their frustrations over the discrimination tactics. 
            It saddens me to think that fifty years later we are still protesting for basic rights and equality. </p>

<p> All this success happened in a single day of taking some action and putting yourself out there to be heard. The broader theme of this source is that the path to your goals will not come without obstacles. 
    The Freedom Riders’ goal was to ride down route 40 and protest sit-ins at various restaurants to promote desegregation. Little did they know that they would be faced with angry civilians at the city of Aberdeen or that 
    they would have multiple arrests of their members that day. All was peaceful to begin with but you never know what may be thrown in your way. This source helps us understand the civil rights movement locally because it 
    is so familiar in ways. The movement is not as familiar to many, as we did not experience it, but when we hear about demonstrations and protests that happened in our neighborhoods and restaurants, 
    it becomes very real and opens up a new perspective to the civil rights movement. We realize that we are eating at the same restaurants and driving down the same highways as did the Freedom Riders when they were 
    fighting for racial equality before we were even alive! It makes the civil rights movement seem more real to me individually as opposed to reading about what Rosa Parks did when sitting in the front of a bus in Virginia. 
    It captures our attention and inspires us to make a difference in today’s racial conflicts. The reading helps us understand small victories as opposed to what we learn about in the textbook readings. 
    Chapters 28 and 29 from the textbook teach us the general idea about the large organizations such as the NAACP, SNCC, MFDP, and more. 
    The textbook does touch the topic of students participating in freedom rides, but never goes into detail. It is fine to learn about these things but hearing about the demonstrations in your hometown area and seeing the small 
    victories that can happen to make a difference makes it much easier and more interesting to read and learn about. 
    One particular quote that really stuck out to me and helped me learn more about the civil rights movement was when the newspaper talked about James Peck and his involvement with the Freedom Riders. 
    James Peck was fully involved in this movement as he was an editor for the CORE magazine and a founder of the Freedom Riders! 
    This man’s whole life revolved around fighting for racial equality and he even took some beatings for it as well. This taught me that putting effort into something that you are passionate about can help make a difference. 
    Even if his efforts didn’t create racial equality around the world, it made a difference to even just 35 restaurants desegregating their institutions in my hometown. 
    When you hear about success like that, it makes you seem like a true hero to the people and causes that you fight for. </p>

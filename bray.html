<p>Doing this project made me think about things I had never even considered before. I had studied the Civil Rights Movement in the past, but never studied how it changed Harford County. 
    The inequalities that I found were sad, but I am glad that the change in the past 50 years is noticeable. Equal opportunity and fair housing have come a long a way in Harford County, as well as America as a whole. 
    This project shed a new light on areas that I would not have researched on my own, but I am glad that I could learn about Civil Rights in Harford County.  </p>

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<i>Lindsey Ajello</i>

<div class="content">
<p>Once Dr. Williams graduated college and fulfilled his dream of becoming a teacher, African Americans faced another set of challenges. 
    In other counties around the state there were teachers that were being abused by the system. There were teachers elsewhere being lured into taking positions in other counties and then once they are there, 
    no matter how long they were a teacher in their old school they could be fired and not given much of a reason to why they were. 
    Dr. Williams fought with other black teachers and educators to get a legal statement that all teachers (no matter what race or background) had the right to a fair salary and benefits to match their tenure. 
    He worked with Thurgood Marshall to get this legal backing from the state government.</p>

<p>In conclusion, this source helped show how bad things were back then, even in Harford County. It opened my eyes to the problems in both the school system and the community. 
    It really described the way African Americans were treated differently than whites and held back from succeeding in life. The fact that the person being interviewed is from the area where I grew up, 
    helped a significant amount with my understanding of the movement as a whole.  </p>

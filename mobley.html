<p>This lecture provided many interesting facts concerning the Civil Rights movement in Maryland. Cambridge the home of Phillips Seafood Packing Co. seems like it was a powerful 
    company during that time and had lots of employment opportunities for that region. The lecturer states that layoffs were prevalent and mainly affected the African American communities the most.  
    It is amazing to hear how anytime someone begins to stand up for equality, there is always some type of opposition. That is true till this day.  
    White business owners did not want them to organize and called in the National guard into try to dismantle organizing. Gloria Richardson and SNIC organized during that time for better jobs and housing. 
    African Americans have been fighting since the slavery for basic accommodation and rights that all other Americans are afforded.  This organizing got the attention of Robert Kennedy and he tried to help by coming up with a 
    treaty between the White Business owners and the African American organizations,  Unfortunately there were not anyone to enforce the treaty because focus was lost when President John F. Kennedy was assassinated.  
    LBJ was able to pass the Civil Rights Law. This was supposed to fix many problems.  Not so.    In 1967 H. Rap Brown is now the leader of SNIC and was holding a rally in Cambridge which he was shot, 
    but then fire breaks out and half the town burns down. He is blamed for the fire and was convicted for arson. Till this day he is still incarcerated.  Martin Luther King was assassinated in April 1968. 
    Riots were all over America. Well we are still having riots now.  More recently in Baltimore 2015, Freddie Gray was beaten and eventually died at the hands of police.  
    Protest ensued and fights broke out store fronts are destroyed. At this time, a new movement was started “Black Lives Matter”. African Americans are still fighting for the same things jobs, housing, voting, education, 
    police brutality etc.</p>

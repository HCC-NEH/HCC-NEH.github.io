<p> This article (BB Article) was published November 27th, 1955 specifically focused on Harford County.  The school system had 21 African American students attend segregated schools in the county.  
    This was the first suit of this kind to filed in Maryland to “charge that the children are being denied their constitutional rights under the fourteenth amendment.”  
    The US ruled that segregation in schools is unconstitutional in 1954.  With that being said this group of students petitioned to Harford County Public Schools for integration in July and were denied.  
    This is a perfect example how the civil rights movement needed focus in Harford county, they were not treating everyone as equals.  
    With the Civil Rights focusing on equal rights and treating African Americans fairly this was a prime example of that not taking place.  
    An article posted in the Baltimore Sun September 14, 1993 speaks in detail about Stephen P. Moore Jr.  Stephen is who sued the school system on behalf of his son who was attending a segregated school.  
    Stephen was a principal at the time of the lawsuit.  Stephen became principal of Bel Air colored High school in 1935 prior to the 1954 segregation being unconstitutional.  
    This was the first colored school for African Americans in Harford County.  Moore remained in the school system as a principal and other positions until he retied in 1967.  
    A quote in this article that really captures the severity of this situation is "My father said I wasn't going to a segregated school, so in the wake of Brown vs. Board of Education, he filed suit," 
    recalled his son, Stephen P. Moore 3rd of Bel Air. "I had been attending Central Consolidated School, which was built to simply pacify blacks. After we won the case, I attended the all-white Bel Air Elementary School." 
    Just reading this quote is a realization of how terrible this was.  Building a school to simply “pacify blacks” is wrong and violates equal rights.  After the laws suit Moore’s son attending Bel Air Elementary makes 
    you think why a lawsuit had to take place for this to occur.  That student and all others should have been attending the schools that were in the area they were living not based on the color of their skin.  
    This article highlights how far Harford County Public School system has come since that time.   All students attend school’s in the area of which they live with the exception of “boundary exceptions” at the parent’s request.  
    HCPS is an equal opportunity and hires appropriately without segregation.</p> 
    
<p>Going back to the early 1900’s when African Americans were fighting for equal opportunities, jobs, and to be fairly treated we have moved tremendously since that time as a nation.  
    Although with the recent activities in the world we obviously have much to do to overcome challenges.   
    It is frustrating that something that is simply put as treating everyone fairly no matter your race or beliefs is so hard for some to do.  I hope that our nation can bring everyone together to accomplish this.  
    Again, we have come far since 1900 but have much more to accomplish.  This 1955 lawsuit is example of how we have learned from our behavior and what is not right needs to be corrected.</p>
